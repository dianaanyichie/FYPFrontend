    <h3>What is an Endangered Species?</h3>
    <div class="info-box red-bg">
      <p>Some animals are in big trouble because there aren’t many of them left. This is called being “endangered.” 
        It means they could disappear forever if we don’t help. 
        Animals become endangered when things like losing their homes, dirty air and water, too much hunting, 
        or changes in the weather make it hard for them to survive.</p>

        <h4>Habitat Loss</h4>
        <p>When people cut down trees, build cities, or use land for farming, animals lose their homes. 
          Without their homes, it’s hard for them to stay alive.</p>

      <p>There’s a group called the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). They make a special list called the “Red List.”
